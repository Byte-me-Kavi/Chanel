Security Features in My Project
================================

This doc explains how I handled security in my Laravel project.

1. Authentication
-----------------
I used Laravel Jetstream which comes with login, register, forgot password already built in.
Users get sessions after logging in and it handles everything automatically.

Password are hashed with bcrypt so nobody can see the actual password in database.

2. User Roles
-------------
I added a role column to users table with values 'user' or 'admin'.
Regular users can shop and view orders.
Admin users can access the admin panel to manage stuff.

I made a middleware (AdminMiddleware.php) that checks if user is admin before letting them access /admin routes.

3. Protected Routes
-------------------
Some pages need you to be logged in:
- /orders - your order history
- /wishlist - your saved items
- /dashboard - user dashboard

Used auth:sanctum middleware for these.

Admin routes are protected by my AdminMiddleware.

4. CSRF Protection
------------------
All my forms have @csrf tag which prevents cross-site request forgery attacks.
Laravel does this automatically, I just had to add @csrf in every form.

5. Input Validation
-------------------
I validate user input in controllers using $request->validate().
For example when adding product:
- name is required
- price must be a number
- email must be valid email format

This prevents bad data from getting into the database.

6. SQL Injection Prevention
---------------------------
I used Eloquent ORM which automatically uses prepared statements.
So queries like Product::where('id', $id) are safe from SQL injection.

7. XSS Prevention
-----------------
Blade templates escape output by default using {{ }}.
So if someone tries to inject <script> tags it won't execute.

8. Password Requirements
------------------------
Passwords need to be at least 8 characters.
User has to confirm password when registering.
Used Laravel's Password::default() rule.

9. Mass Assignment Protection
-----------------------------
All my models have $fillable array that specifies which fields can be mass assigned.
This prevents attackers from setting fields they shouldn't (like role).

10. Sessions
------------
Cart data is stored in sessions.
Sessions are server-side so users can't tamper with cart prices etc.

That's basically how I handled security. Most of it comes built into Laravel which is nice.
